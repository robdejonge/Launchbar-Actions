###About###

This script makes it easy to convert currencies right from LaunchBar, a great tool from Objective Development.

###User Guide###

- Ensure the script has been indexed by LaunchBar
- Select it and hit <space> to enter the search query
- Query is in the format '#src to dst' where src are currency symbols and # is the amount being converted, eg. '15usd to eur'. The word 'to' in that query is optional, there can however be no space between '15' and 'usd' for the time being. Hit enter to query.
- The script will consult Google servers to perform the currency conversion. 
- The result is displayed 'in large type', Cmd-C copies this to the clipboard or any other key dismisses.
